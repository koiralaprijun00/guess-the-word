## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: A dynamic gradient from Bright Yellow (`#FFD700`) at the top, transitioning smoothly to Vibrant Orange (`#FFA500`) in the middle, and ending with Deep Magenta (`#FF00FF`) at the bottom. This gradient should evoke energy and focus while still providing a visually engaging backdrop for the Devanagari script.
- Background Color: Light gray (`#F4F3F8`), nearly white, to ensure optimal readability for the Devanagari script. This provides a neutral, calming base that contrasts well with the vibrant gradient.
- Accent Color: Muted Blue (`#7DD3FC`) to highlight interactive elements (like buttons and the timer). This cool accent provides a pleasing contrast to the warm primary gradient.
- Fonts: Clear and legible fonts optimized for both Devanagari and English text. Devanagari: (e.g., Arial Unicode MS, Noto Sans Devanagari, or a similar highly readable Devanagari typeface). English: (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, or a similar sans-serif typeface).
- Sizes: Titles: Large and prominent (e.g., `2.5rem` or `40px` for main titles, `1.5rem` or `24px` for subheadings). Body Text (Devanagari & English): Clear and comfortable for reading (e.g., `1.2rem` or `19px`).
- Layout: Clean, centered layout. The primary focus should be on the presented word, ensuring it's prominent and easy to read.
- Spacing: Ample spacing around the word and UI elements to reduce visual clutter and promote focus.
- Word Reveal: Subtle fade-in animations for word reveal.
- Timer Transitions: Smooth transitions for timer updates. These animations should provide gentle visual feedback without being distracting.
